  "encyclopediaPunkt1Text": "Children love attention, approval, play - this is inherent in nature. It is important to know that children perceive themselves through the prism of our opinion about them, which we express out loud.\\n\\nIf we tell children about their achievements, they develop confidence in their abilities, they are no longer afraid of new challenges, as they have their own personal a positive experience is the most important thing for their success in the future. By approving and recording achievements, we form a very important background for their entire future life.",
  "encyclopediaPunkt2Title": "Clear game rules and achievable goals. Dopamine!",
  "encyclopediaPunkt2Text": "Why do people sometimes go into gaming? Psychologists explain this by the fact that there a person finds simple and achievable goals, easily receives encouragement, collects many \"awards\" and \"approvals\" that are disproportionate to his efforts.\n\nAnd although both are intangible, the brain likes it, it receives “cheap” dopamine (the hormone of joy, pleasure).\n\nWhat if such rules were extended to the acquisition of good habits? Any completed task is a checkmark. And the tasks are selected so that they are simple and understandable at the first stages. As for the awards, here parents will be able to act according to the situation, depending on their ideas about education.\n\nEncouragement can be in the form of joint leisure with children, shopping, treats, events, interesting hobbies. Every parent knows better what will be more useful and enjoyable.",
  "encyclopediaPunkt3Title": "Not a drop of addiction, on the contrary - new qualities of character, new heights.",
  "encyclopediaPunkt3Text": "A baby tracker helps to develop a habit, it is no longer required.\n\nAny child will gladly want to do unloved things himself, if he sees additional value in this. Each time he receives positive reinforcement, he gradually gets used to doing routines and does not need further encouragement.\n\nHis reward is the result: \"I could\", \"I did it.\" For the parent, it will be noticeable that in addition to the fulfilled requests and deeds, the child has developed new useful qualities of his character and has become more successful in general.",
  "encyclopediaPunkt4Title": "Conclusion, briefly about everything",
  "encyclopediaPunkt4Text": "Kids will love putting away toys, laying out clothes, keeping things clean, doing homework, going to bed on time, and more. In return, they will receive the ability to work, value time and resources, and achieve what they want with their work. But most importantly, they will acquire key character traits that will help them achieve adult goals in the future and in the present.",
  "encyclopediaPunkt5Title": "Introduction to the game",
  "encyclopediaPunkt5Text": "The purpose of the game is to teach the child (and, if necessary, learn it yourself) to happily perform routine tasks without any extra effort.\n\nThe victory condition for the child is to take responsibility for a certain work or action, to do it qualitatively.\n\nThe victory for the parent is to teach the child to order and create a positive association for him for life, so that even without the use of the system, cleaning and any routine can be done easily.\n\nBonus - in the process of accustoming another, you learn yourself.\n\nA reward for a child is a reward that the child chooses, but you can do without it - at later stages.\n\nReward for the parent - Responsible child assistants, full-fledged family members, and not just freeloaders-guests.",
  "encyclopediaPunkt6Title": "The history of the tracker",
  "encyclopediaPunkt6Text": "Sometimes we, parents, are afraid to pay attention to children's achievements, approve, praise, so as not to “frighten away” the results.\n\nIn our family, disorder in children's things, disorganization and some indifference of children were commonplace. We constantly lacked the strength to change everything, to make a revolution, to teach children to maintain order and beauty.\n\nAnd yes, there was nothing to praise.\n\nAnd then one day we heard from a famous Russian psychologist, mother of 11 children, this: \"Try the point system, don't be afraid, it's not harmful.\" We had doubts for a long time, we thought that our children would think only in terms of points, think only about “earnings”, but there was simply no other way out, the mess from the nursery multiplied endlessly and “strangled” us. We decided and started a poster with actions and marks in points for each.\nThe system performed well immediately.",
